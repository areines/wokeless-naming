# wokeless-naming config.yml
# The fully un-cucked, non-cucked edition.
# Every single woke soy-term is now flagged with extreme prejudice.
# We suggest the original based, non-cucked language because 2010 called and wants its sane codebase back.
# Severity is error everywhere — your feelings are not a valid CI status.
